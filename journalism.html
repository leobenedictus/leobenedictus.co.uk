        I spent 15 years as a freelance feature writer, mainly for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leobenedictus">Guardian</a>. I also wrote for other newspapers, magazines and websites, including the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200911-the-hidden-accents-that-betray-who-you-are">BBC</a>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/author/leo-benedictus/">New Scientist</a>, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/author/Leo-Benedictus">Prospect</a>, and the <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/leo-benedictus">London Review of Books</a>. 
        <br></br>
        My work won awards from Amnesty International, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Work Foundation. 
        <br></br>
        At the beginning of 2020, I joined <a href="https://fullfact.org/">Full Fact</a>, where I've been able to write more often about science and statistics.
        <br></br>
        I am a self-taught data journalist, and can handle the basics of web-scraping, data analysis and visualisation in Python. I build some simple tools using AI models. I also built this website, which will improve.
