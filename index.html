                “Ingeniously nasty… reminiscent of Vladimir Nabokov and Patricia Highsmith… Expect to be provoked by a teasing metafictional game.”
                John Dugdale, <a href = "https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/culture/need-to-know-karen-cleveland-anatomy-scandal-sarah-vaughan-the-wife-alafair-burke-consent-leo-benedictus-thrillers-review-p602w8ktl">Sunday Times</a><br><br>
            
                “Creepily thought-provoking… [The narrator’s] manipulations are so cruel, his acts of violence so vile, that it feels profoundly disconcerting to have ever been seduced by him.”
                Melissa Broder, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/books/review/read-me-leo-benedictus.html?smid=tw-nytbooks&smtyp=cur">The New York Times</a><br><br>
            
                “At times almost unreadably horrible… Consent is thought-provoking as well as shocking… A compulsive dark comedy that entertains and unnerves in equal measure.” ★★★★
                Anthony Cummins, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.metro.news/metro-book-chat-stalkers-tale-of-gender-relations/916653/">Metro</a><br><br>
            A word of warning: do not pick up this novella late at night. Not if you’d like to sleep any time soon… Darkly addictive.
            
                Hephzibah Anderson, The Mail on Sunday<br><br>
            Queasily compelling… Perhaps most unsettling is the narrator’s voice… There is no denying the ingenuity with which Benedictus constructs his tale.
            
                Barry Forshaw, <a href = "https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.ft.com/content/a922c8a4-2878-11e8-9274-2b13fccdc744">The Financial Times</a><br><br>
            This is a novel that plays with the conventions of the form… great subtlety and wit… unusual and enormously compelling.
            
                Alex Preston, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/21/consent-by-leo-benedictus-fear-by-dirk-kurbjuweit-review">The Observer</a><br><br>
            Another clever, cutting riff on the book-within-a book… this strangely congenial thriller-cum-treatise ends on a note of provocative ambiguity.
            
                Catherine Taylor, <a href ="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/25/consent-leo-benedictus-review?CMP=twt_books_b-gdnbooks">The Guardian</a><br><br>
            A fiendishly clever book, though not for the soft-hearted… You’ll find yourself turning pages in the most disturbing kind of grip.
            
                Cameron Woodhead, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/consent-review-leo-benedictus-psychological-thriller-grips-in-a-disturbing-way-20180226-h0wn7t.html?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_feed">Sydney Morning Herald</a><br><br>
            By turns whimsical and bone-chillingly explicit, Consent is a gripping reimagining of one of the crime genre’s most tired tropes.
            
                Declan Burke, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/crime-fiction-highlights-the-woman-in-the-window-genuine-fraud-the-long-silence-one-good-reason-consent-1.3398746">The Irish Times</a><br><br>
            Not a particularly original contribution to an over-saturated genre
            
                Alice Wadsworth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/observation-benedictus/">The Times Literary Supplement</a><br><br>
            Claustrophobic intensity… makes it a memorable and rewarding, if far from comfortable, experience.
            
                Jake Kerridge, The Sunday Express<br><br>
            We’ll warn you now: Benedictus’s latest book - a psychopathic stalker’s journal - is pitch black. The stuff of nightmares.
            
                Anon, Shortlist<br><br>
            Consent is a carefully crafted and completely chilling novel where all the possibilities are open – until they suddenly snap closed. Book of the Week
            
                David Herkt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/102779245/book-of-the-week-april-7-2018">Stuff</a><br><br>
            Part-crime, part-thriller, part-horror novel from the much-praised author of The Afterparty… This is a disturbing book.
            
                Sebastian Shakespeare, Tatler<br><br>
            If you want to be nearly scared to death, this is the book for you.
            
                Anon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.whichbook.net/book.aspx?id=12172">Whichbook.net</a><br><br>
            Consent is a pacy and chilling thriller about our voyeuristic obsession with other people.
                Mark, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/http://wordsshortlist.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/consent-by-leo-benedictus.html">The Word’s Shortlist</a><br><br>

            His sparse, clean style… grips the reader in its claws… For those who enjoy clever and unsettling thrillers, this one is unmissable.
            
                Kelly Pells, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/16052157.Clever_and_unsettling_thriller_from_Guardian_journalist/">This is Local London</a><br><br>
            Such a great read and the product of a highly entertaining and disturbingly dark mind. If I was a friend of Leo Benedictus, I’d be reconsidering my options.
            
                Stephen Mangan<br><br>
            Beautiful writing and a modest, pensive protagonist… A brilliant and goosebumpy read!
            
                Susan Crawford<br><br>
            A darkly elegant thriller - I was enthralled.
            
                Renée Knight<br><br>
            A fascinating, disturbing and original thriller that erases the boundaries of the genre and draws challenging new ones
            
                Sophie Hannah<br><br>
            Read Me offers a salacious, disturbing, and increasingly focused look into the mind of a stalker.
            
                Michael Ruzicka, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://www.booklistonline.com/Read-Me-Leo-Benedictus/pid=9497268">Booklist</a><br><br>
            Absolutely superb… a truly dark and deliciously twisted thriller… Benedictus is completely without fear… I was mesmerised.
            
                Raven, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://ravencrimereads.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/theres-always-someone-watching-leo-benedictus-consent-james-lasdun-the-fall-guy/">Raven Crime Reads</a><br><br>
            Fantastic… really got into my head… Engaging but unnerving, creepy but intriguing. I was gripped from start to finish! There are so many elements of this book that I want to praise.
            
                Ronnie Turner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://ronnieturner.wordpress.com/2018/02/21/consent-by-leo-benedictus-bookreview-consent/">Blog</a><br><br>
            It is a short novel, but one which you won’t forget in a hurry… I was appalled and approving in equal measure… Whilst it is certainly not for the faint hearted, it is a compelling and clever read.
            
                Anon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/http://honestbookaholic.com/review-of-consent-by-leo-benedictus/">Honestbookaholic.com</a><br><br>
            It’s dark as pitch on a black night in the height of winter, and at times it’s a little neat, but for all that it’s an almighty page turner that will have you in its grip until the final page.
            
                Anon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://bookmunch.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/dark-as-pitch-on-a-black-night-in-the-height-of-winter-consent-by-leo-benedictus/">Bookmunch</a><br><br>
            Leo Benedictus gradually pulls the reader into his character’s nightmare mind… a clever and satisfying second novel.
            
                Anne Goodwin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/http://annegoodwin.weebly.com/annecdotal/people-studies-sight-consent">Annethology</a><br><br>
            Leo Benedictus is prepared to take risks… This is a stylish psycho thriller… And it ends with a bang!
            
                Toria Forsyth-Moser, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/http://thecrimewarp.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/consent-by-leo-benedictus-book-review.html">The Crime Warp</a><br><br>
            A literary stalker novel with a wicked difference… its tale of lies, love and deceit unfolds in snake-like manner… Compelling and unsettling both.
            
                Maxim Jakobowski, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/http://www.crimetime.co.uk/max-maxim-jakubowski-new-crime-2/">Crime Time</a><br><br>
            It is intelligently written and the idea is horrible… It was a decent read, and it’s disturbing, graphic in parts, but I was left scratching my head.
            
                Lolly K Dandeneau, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190913131425/https://bookstalkerblog.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/read-me-a-novel-by-leo-benedictus/">BookStalkerBlog</a><br><br>
            A queasily compelling novel that demands shuddering admiration.
